I have six Raspberry Pi's networked together with a shared NAS. That Coral chip is mostly for manual fun for now, but expect an interactive site later.

Blog Stack:
Hugo on NGINX Docker container, with cloudfare DDoS prevention and caching.


### Future Improvements
- use self hosted gitlab for CI/CD
- get site running on k3s
- TLS
- interactive gitlab project so people can edit this site for fun
- Family photo site w/ secured logins
- ability to email "observations" and have the site update itself
