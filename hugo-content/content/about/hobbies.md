# Current (Obsession):
### Paragliding
I got my P2, and have been to a few different sites. It's truly a fun sport and I can't wait to get my P3 and many more hours in! The feeling of flying just felt so "right" from the beginning- even better than sailing. Working on P3 now!!

> Obviously paragliding is the most fun part!
### Hunting
My new ADHD hobby obsession is hunting. I've just set up my .308 Tikka T3x Roughtech Ember with a Leupold VX 3HD, and am ready to sight it in! My eventual goal is to follow in the footsteps of my mentor from my first job and bag an elk every year. I'll save the rest for it's own post, but the meat is so good!

# Current (Sidelined):
### Surfing
It's getting a little too crowded near Law St Beach where I live, but mostly walking the pup or going to the gym takes up my mornings...
### Dirt Biking
I used to go with my dad a lot, now I'm pretty far. Downsides is the 2.5hr drive to get somewhere good, gas costs, maintenence. 
# Past (no plan to return):
### Rock climbing outdoors
I went with a friend on a trip to Heuco Tanks, and found the "bouldering" there frequently included 40' topouts with no real saftey possible below. On top of that the rocks just bled all sensation and skin from my fingers and I realized while I like the views and being in nature with fun people, I did not like risking my life for it.

I might still be a lil traumatized from my old best friend Sam dying while rock climbing, or perhaps I just suck at climbing. Either way, I'm pretty over it.
# Future:
### Ham Radio License
Other than for fun chats, and the fact that I wanted to get it while a boy scout, my real corny dream is to get a cybertruck with my ham radio callsign vanity plate to show my true nerd status. 
### Paramotoring
The dream here is to get the travallable OpenPPG electric paramotor, and just use it to get to places where I can thermal around in absolute silence. I imagine it'll also be super helpful to quickly get out of bailout situations.
