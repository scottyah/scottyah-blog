# Current (Obsession):
### Paragliding
Currently getting my P1&P2 combo from Torrey Pines. My life is basically work, leetcode, keeping the homefront together, and paragliding.
Obviously paragliding is the most fun part!

# Current (Sidelined):
### Surfing
It's getting a little too crowded near Law St Beach where I live, but mostly walking the pup or going to the gym takes up my mornings...
### Dirt Biking
I used to go with my dad a lot, now I'm pretty far. Downsides is the 2.5hr drive to get somewhere good, gas costs, maintenence. 
# Past (no plan to return):
### Rock climbing outdoors
I went with a friend on a trip to Heuco Tanks, and found the "bouldering" there frequently included 40' topouts with no real saftey possible below. On top of that the rocks just bled all sensation and skin from my fingers and I realized while I like the views and being in nature with fun people, I did not like risking my life for it.

I might still be a lil traumatized from my old best friend Sam dying while rock climbing, or perhaps I just suck at climbing. Either way, I'm pretty over it.
# Future:
### Ham Radio License
### Paramotoring
The dream here is to get the travallable OpenPPG electric paramotor, and just use it to get to places where I can thermal around in absolute silence. I imagine it'll also be super helpful to quickly get out of bailout situations.
