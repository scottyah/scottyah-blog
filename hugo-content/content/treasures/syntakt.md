### Elektron Syntakt and cover

I'd been overcome with a strong desire to make music, as both a creative outlet and something I felt called to.
I'm in love with synth sounds and figured this would be a great place to start since I seem to mostly be sick of being on a computer by the time I get home.

Eventually I'll upload some stuff here, but it relly is amazing how you can just noodle for hours and completely change a track without even starting a new one! So far I've been loving it.
