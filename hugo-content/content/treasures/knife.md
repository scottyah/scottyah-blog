### Benchmade Taggedout

I misplaced my good ol package opening kershaw at my wedding reception and it put me on the hunt for a new knife. Mostly I need it for hunting, but I'll for sure need it for all pocket-knife uses.

There was a new version of the taggedout, but I tried it in my REI and wasn't in love, the old version was almost $100 cheaper, more purpose-built, and there was only one left at EVERY REI worldwide, so I bought it online in the store.

It came in today and so far is probably exactly what I want, it'll come in handy paragliding and cutting salame LOL.

I decided to get a folding knife because they're smaller and lighter, and they're good enough for Randy Newberg. His branded Gerber DTS one seemed cool, but in the end I just liked this one more.
