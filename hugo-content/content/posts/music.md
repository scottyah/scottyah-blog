### So I bought a syntakt

It's been awhile now that I've been watching youtubes of people making music while working. I debated between the syntakt and the OP1, but noodling with notes themselves excites me the most so I went with the one with an analog synth in it.

There's a lot to learn, but it's awesome just listening to the samples and playing with them a bit while working. I hope to post some progress tracks as I make them, but I now understand why it's so hard to ship music- it's just so fun to constantly change things and discover new sounds/vibes as you go. There is very rarely a point where you feel done.
