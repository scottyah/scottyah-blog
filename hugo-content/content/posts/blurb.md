Grandad died today.
The longest day of the year, probably the shortest day of his life.

Keslyn is mad at me for bad communication lol

Zoey pee'd herself

I wanted to go to bed early, now its late

I looked at buying a synth thing today, I hope I don't

Tinkering on the website makes me sane, i should do it more

time to face tomorrow

yours truly,
scott
