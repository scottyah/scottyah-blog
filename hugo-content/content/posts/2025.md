Wow lots of changes since I last posted. I finally got around to creating a new server, Omarchy on a beelink. I've just loaded this site for continuty, but plan on really getting the calbo site going. It's mostly ready, just working on the Stripe Checout stuff. Also plan to see the little house awards site I made using cursor and a Jury Duty day haha.

I've bought a house with my wife and have spent most of my time fixing it up. I have tons of footage that needs to be edited, but that's not a passion of mine so we'll see.

Overall, my big goal is to get some alternative or passive income now that all the stocks are now converted to the house, and kids are coming soon.

Build with me :)
