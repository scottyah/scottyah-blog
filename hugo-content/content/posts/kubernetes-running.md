So it's been awhile. I've resurrected this blog after many changes to the ol' bramble. right now the main site is hosting my wedding website I created from as-scratch-as-you-can-get while still using all the latest software ~~toys~~ tools.

Updates to setup:
- K3s for almost all content
- Traefik for ingress
- TLS
- Runs behind cloudfare for safety (both hackers and pi processing load)
- I started py-api and go-api subdomains so i can play with the two languages with this website

I think that's the most of it. On the current todo list:
- add some fun APIs in python and go
- add my paragliding flight data
- add my paragliding weather analyzer
