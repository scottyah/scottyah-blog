#### New Obsession Alert!

This one is actually kind of old, it just hasn't happened yet.

## Why Hunting?
As always, there's a few reasons:
*. I've been trusting the meat in grocery stores less. From the price fluctuations to the saline-pumping chicken to the weirdly fed beef, I just get a weird feeling that grows inside me.
*. The meat industry sucks. The abuse is pretty bad, and I should go vegan really buuuut...
*. I love meat. I really like the taste of most meats and they seem to be great with the IBS issues that I've been facing for the last few years. Some of my best adult gut health were the years in CO where I'd regularly eat Costco Top Round steak and bell peppers.
*. I had a mentor in an earlier job that really turned me on to the philosophy and even nobility of hunting. There's a lot more to it than my LA culture let on.
*. The challenge, reward, and exercise of it all ( for elk especially, which is my goal )

## What I'm doing to prepare
I've found some friends/family that are down to join me for a hunting school since none of us ever got experience growing up. It'll be in November and cover the basics. I've (of course) bought some fun toys for this latest hobby and can't wait to try them out! 
I've been watching a lot of youtube videos and bought an old book about Big Game in North America.
With intro hunt and gear set, my next step will be to learn to analyze terrain for certain animals and where I want to try to get some tags, hopefully withing cybertruck driving distance!

Another day, another expensive hobby! I'd love to find a way to combine this with other passions, eventually I think it'd be AMAZING to get a real good GOHUNT style youtube video made of paragliding into a hunt...
